    // without knowing the specific types

    // know if address changes in case there is a cross property validation rule where we 
    // check address content; address might be fine by itself
    // know if address has any errors (to know if entity is ok)
    // know if address has any changes (for reverting)
    // ability to accept and reject
    //
    // model must expose an IObservable of various property statuses
